# Git Introduction

## Activity 1 - Branches, staging and commits
* Create a new branch using your name as the branch name. Select the checkout branch option on creation.
* Create a new file in the solution explorer "yourname.md"
* Add some text to the file and save it
* Stage your changes
* Enter a commit message and select commit all and push

## Activity 2 - Pull request
* Open View -> Git Repository
* Right click on the main branch and create a new pull request
* The base branch will be "main" and set the compare to "YourNameGoesHere"
* Click create pull request
* Click merge pull request
* Click confirm merge
* Return to the code page on Github and look at the main branch 
* Ensure you can now see the file you created "yourname.md

## Activity 3 - Squash vs Merge
* Checkout your branch
* Change and save your file, commit and push your changes -> do this three times
* Visit the insights tab on the GitHub page and select network to see the corresponding visualization
* Create a new pull request for your branch
* Two people merge branch to main, the other two people squash and merge to the main branch
* Once all are complete, return to the insights tab and view the network.

## Activity 4 - Development & feature branches
* Checkout the development branch
* Create a new branch based off the development branch called "InsertFeatureNameHere"
* Create and save a new file, commit and push the change to your feature branch
* Merge the changes into the development branch
* Once all are complete, return to the insights tab and view the network.

# Discussion - Rebase
* What happens when the main branch continues to be updated while you are working on your feature?
* We can use rebase to bring our feature branch up to date with either the main/development branch
